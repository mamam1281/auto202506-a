# CC Webapp - Conceptual Production Rollout Plan

This document outlines the conceptual phases and key considerations for rolling out the CC Webapp to a production environment. It assumes that comprehensive testing and validation have been successfully completed in a staging environment that closely mirrors production.

## I. Pre-Deployment Phase (Preparation & Final Checks)

1.  **Code Freeze & Release Candidate Finalization:**
    *   [ ] **Code Freeze:** Announce and enforce a code freeze on the main/release branch designated for this production version (e.g., `release/v1.0.0` or `main` if using Gitflow-like release branches). No new features or non-critical bug fixes should be merged.
    *   [ ] **Final Code Review:** Conduct thorough reviews for any last-minute critical fixes or changes included in the release candidate.
    *   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Green:** Ensure all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) are consistently passing in the CI/CD pipeline against the final release candidate build.
    *   [ ] **Security Sign-off:**
        *   Final review of static code analysis (SAST) reports.
        *   Confirm results of dependency vulnerability scans (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`) have been reviewed and any critical/high vulnerabilities are addressed (patched, mitigated, or risk accepted).
        *   Review results of dynamic application security testing (DAST) if performed on staging.
    *   [ ] **Build & Tag Final Artifacts:** Build the final production-ready Docker images for backend and frontend. Tag these images with the release version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and potentially a consistent tag like `stable` or `production`. Push these images to the production container registry (e.g., ECR, GCR, Docker Hub private).

2.  **Production Environment Setup & Verification:**
    *   [ ] **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
        *   Ensure production-grade servers/clusters (e.g., Kubernetes, ECS, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, managed PaaS like Heroku/App Engine) are provisioned, configured, and scaled according to capacity plans.
        *   Set up production database (e.g., RDS, Cloud SQL, managed PostgreSQL service) with automated backups, point-in-time recovery (PITR), replication (read replicas if needed), and appropriate sizing/scaling configurations.
        *   Set up production Redis (e.g., ElastiCache, MemoryStore, managed Redis service) with correct sizing, persistence (if needed), and security.
        *   Set up production Kafka cluster (e.g., MSK, Confluent Cloud, self-managed with Zookeeper, configured for high availability and data retention).
    *   [ ] **Networking & Security Configuration:**
        *   Configure Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, Network ACLs, and Security Groups/Firewalls to allow necessary traffic while restricting unauthorized access.
        *   Set up DNS records for the production domain (e.g., `app.cc-webapp.com`, `api.cc-webapp.com`) pointing to the load balancer or ingress controller.
        *   Obtain, install, and configure SSL/TLS certificates for the production domain (e.g., using ACM, Let's Encrypt via Certbot, or other CAs). Ensure auto-renewal is in place.
        *   Configure a production-grade reverse proxy/load balancer (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, ALB/ELB/Cloud Load Balancing) for SSL termination, load balancing across instances, and routing to backend/frontend services.
    *   [ ] **Configuration Management & Secrets:**
        *   Use a secure secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager) for all production secrets (database credentials, API keys, JWT secret, Sentry DSN).
        *   Prepare and validate production environment configuration files or environment variables. Ensure no default/development credentials or settings are used.
        *   Verify `SENTRY_DSN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `KAFKA_BROKER`, `JWT_SECRET` are securely configured and accessible to the application instances.
    *   [ ] **Logging & Monitoring Infrastructure:**
        *   Ensure centralized logging is set up for all services (e.g., ELK stack, CloudWatch Logs, Datadog Logs).
        *   Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from production backend instances (and potentially other services like Kafka/DB exporters).
        *   Set up Grafana dashboards for production monitoring (API performance, system resources, Kafka/DB/Redis metrics, business KPIs).
        *   Configure Sentry for production error tracking using the production DSN and appropriate environment tagging.
        *   Set up critical alerts in Grafana/Alertmanager or other monitoring tools (e.g., high error rates, critical latency spikes, system down, Kafka consumer lag, low disk space) to notify the operations/on-call team.

3.  **Data Migration & Backup:**
    *   [ ] **Final Backup:** Take a full backup of the production database immediately before any schema changes or data migrations.
    *   [ ] **Test Data Migration Scripts:** Ensure Alembic migration scripts have been thoroughly tested in staging and are idempotent if possible. Review scripts for any potentially destructive changes or long-locking operations.
    *   [ ] **Verify Backup & Recovery Plan:** Confirm automated database backup procedures are in place and regularly tested. Document and review data recovery steps.

4.  **Rollback Plan Finalization:**
    *   [ ] Identify the current stable production version (commit hash, Docker image tags, e.g., `v0.9.x`).
    *   [ ] Document the detailed procedure to quickly roll back to this version if the new deployment encounters critical issues. This includes application code/images and database schema (if downgrades are feasible and tested).
    *   [ ] Ensure rollback configurations (e.g., previous image tags in deployment scripts) are readily available.

5.  **Communication & Scheduling:**
    *   [ ] **Schedule Deployment Window:** Choose a low-traffic period if possible. Communicate this window clearly.
    *   [ ] **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform internal teams (support, marketing, etc.) and potentially users (if downtime or significant changes are expected) about the deployment schedule, expected duration, and any potential impact.
    *   [ ] **Prepare Status Updates:** Draft templates for communication during the deployment (e.g., "Deployment started," "X% complete," "Encountering issues," "Deployment successful," "Rollback initiated").

## II. Deployment Phase (Execution)

1.  **Maintenance Mode (If Applicable):**
    *   [ ] If significant downtime is expected or there's a high risk of user impact, enable a user-facing maintenance page (e.g., via load balancer or a temporary static page).

2.  **Deploy Database Migrations:**
    *   [ ] Execute database migration scripts (`alembic upgrade head` or equivalent) against the production database. This is a critical step and should be monitored closely.
    *   [ ] Verify that migrations completed successfully and check database health.

3.  **Deploy Backend Service(s):**
    *   [ ] Deploy the new version of the backend Docker image(s) (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
    *   [ ] Use a chosen deployment strategy (e.g., blue/green, canary, rolling update). For blue/green, deploy to a new set of instances and switch traffic after verification. For canary, route a small percentage of traffic to the new version first.
    *   [ ] Verify backend instances pass health checks and are registered with the load balancer.
    *   [ ] Monitor application logs, error rates (Sentry), and key performance metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) immediately after deployment to the new instances.

4.  **Deploy Frontend Service(s):**
    *   [ ] Deploy the new version of the frontend Docker image(s).
    *   [ ] Similar deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, rolling update) should be used.
    *   [ ] Update CDN configurations, clear caches if necessary.
    *   [ ] Verify the frontend is serving the new version and connecting to the new backend (if applicable, or existing backend during a phased rollout).

5.  **Initial Smoke Testing & Sanity Checks (Production Environment):**
    *   [ ] Perform a predefined set of critical smoke tests on key user flows and functionalities (e.g., user registration, login, core game interactions, new features introduced in this release).
    *   [ ] Verify basic API responses and frontend rendering.

6.  **Disable Maintenance Mode (If Applicable):**
    *   [ ] Once initial smoke tests pass and the system appears stable, remove the maintenance page and allow full user traffic.

7.  **Communication - Deployment Complete:**
    *   [ ] Announce the completion of the deployment to all stakeholders.

## III. Post-Deployment Phase (Monitoring & Stabilization)

1.  **Intensive Monitoring & Alert Response:**
    *   [ ] Closely monitor all production systems (application performance, error rates via Sentry/Grafana, server resources, database performance, Redis metrics, Kafka consumer lag, queue depths) for a predefined "hypercare" period (e.g., first 2-24 hours).
    *   [ ] Ensure the operations/on-call team is on high alert to respond to any critical issues or alerts.

2.  **Verification & Validation:**
    *   [ ] Perform a more thorough set of functional tests and user acceptance testing (UAT) if applicable on the production environment.
    *   [ ] (Optional) Have QA team or designated internal users validate key features and flows.
    *   [ ] Monitor user feedback channels for any reported issues.

3.  **Rollback Execution (If Necessary):**
    *   [ ] If critical issues are detected that cannot be resolved quickly (within a predefined acceptable timeframe), trigger the documented rollback plan to revert to the previous stable version.
    *   [ ] Communicate the rollback and reasons to stakeholders. Conduct a post-mortem on the failure.

4.  **Incident Response & Hotfixes:**
    *   [ ] Have the development and operations teams ready to investigate and deploy hotfixes for any minor, non-critical issues that arise but do not warrant a full rollback.

5.  **Post-Deployment Review / Retrospective:**
    *   [ ] After the deployment has stabilized (e.g., 24-48 hours or one business cycle), schedule and conduct a deployment review meeting (retrospective).
    *   [ ] Discuss what went well, what could have been improved, and any incidents or issues encountered.
    *   [ ] Document lessons learned and update deployment procedures, checklists, and rollback plans for future releases.

6.  **Documentation & Knowledge Base Update:**
    *   [ ] Ensure all relevant internal technical documentation (runbooks, troubleshooting guides, system architecture diagrams) is updated to reflect the new production state.
    *   [ ] Update user-facing documentation or help guides if new features were released.

This conceptual plan provides a comprehensive checklist and should be adapted and detailed further based on the specific technologies, team structure, and operational practices of the CC Webapp project.
